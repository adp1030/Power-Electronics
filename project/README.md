# Planar Transformer Design

### Power Electronics Final Project: Andrew Phillips & Natsuki Sacks

For our final project, we designed a planar transformer to replace the wire wound transformer used in the class's lab hardware. Our design has the same footprint and pinout as the wire wound transformer, so the transformer can be plugged into the lab hardware directly.

The PCB layout was done in KiCad, the design and Gerber files can be found in `layout/planar_transformer_v2`. The transformer was simulated in lab hardware with PLECS, simulation files can be found in the `simulation` folder.
